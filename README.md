# Beta Bank Machine Learning

<h2>Summary</h2>

This project creates a machine learning model that is fine-tuned by evaluating F1 score for a bank to help it predict which customers are likely to leave in the near future in order to prevent customer churn.

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (notebooks > EDA.ipynb)
      
        a) Project introduction
        b) Library and data importation
        c) Data preprocessing - finding and removing duplicate values, filling in missing values, etc.
        d) Data scaling and encoding - encoding the categorical features and scaling all features, as well as splitting the data
        e) Determining the most effective machine learning model based on F1 score
        f) Examining sales as affected by platform, game, user review, and critic review
        g) Drawing conclusions based on game genre
        h) Testing and balancing the model through upsampling and downsampling
        i) Evaluating the AUC-ROC scores and plotting the curves
        j) Project conclusion

<h2>Local Access</h2>

This project will require Python 3.9.13 or later.

All packages required can be installed from the requirements.txt file by executing the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

To run the Jupyter notebook, it can be downloaded from the repository (the main branch) and run in the IDE of your choice that can accommodate.

Please note that the data that was originally provided by the client and is proprietary. It is not available in this repository for that reason.

<h2>Plans for Updates</h2>

There are no plans for updates at this time.
